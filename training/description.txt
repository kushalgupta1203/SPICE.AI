train_v0.1 (9 classifiers, better accuracy)

- Trained on a dataset with 9 classifiers (categories).
- Showed better accuracy compared to other versions.
- The dataset used for this model is no longer available.

train_v1.0 (8 classifiers, dataset modified)

- The dataset was modified, reducing classifiers from 9 to 8.
- Model train_v1.1 was trained on this new dataset.
- Accuracy and performance may have changed due to dataset modification.

Current Focus: Fine-tuning train_v1.0

- Cannot retrain train_v1.0 from scratch as the dataset with 9 classifiers is unavailable.
- Fine-tuning train_v1.0 to improve performance without needing the original dataset.
- The goal is to maintain high accuracy while making necessary adjustments.

UPDATE - Got some of the elements of the earlier dataset and training train_v1.1
